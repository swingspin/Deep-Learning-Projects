# Deep-Learning-Projects
Welcome!
## Introduction:
This file introduces you to Deep Learning Projects:
### 1. Bird Classification Model 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the efficient use of Deep Learning techniques to various types of issues. The following duty was completed: 
Classifying bird images using an existing Deep Learning model (Transfer Learning)
In this task, we used the VGG16 model, with the aim of classifying bird images with a high accuracy. The data in the dataset was already split, as there were the folders: “train”, “test” and “valid”. Each subfolder of each folder contained images of a specific type of bird (Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species).
The dataset you will be using for this task is from:

### 2. CycleGan Model
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the efficient use of Deep Learning techniques to various types of issues. The following duties was completed: 
We trained the CycleGAN model to turn human faces into Cats & Dogs faces in this assignment. The human faces dataset had subfolders containing 256x256 photographs of celebrities, whereas the Cats & dogs dataset included images of various sizes
The dataset of human faces you will use is from:

The dataset of cats and dogs is a combination of three datasets:
Dogs vs Cats: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
Stanford Dogs: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset?select=images
Cat Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/cat-dataset
### 3. Language Model Using NLP
Models capable of generating text are prevalent and present in many aspects of modern life. 
The objective completed here is to train a word-level language model using the text from the book “Poirot Investigates” by Agatha Christie (https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61262).
A language model can predict the next word(s) in a sequence of words (sentence/paragraph).Model uses recurrent layers and is able to generate text when prompted. During 
inference (test time), your trained model will receive some words as its input and generate some 
text (a sentence or a paragraph).Since model is trained on the writings of Agatha Christie, it is expected that any text it generates will follow a roughly similar style.
The dataset can be downloaded here in plain text format:

## Running The Codes
For testing & running the codes the h.5 files and index files are to be loaded in the system along with the .ipynb file and run the testing.
